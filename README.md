# Code assessment by OLEKSII TSIOMA 

Hi there!

This is a simple theme example to showcase my Template Building and WordPress theming skills


## Basic Principles

I use __webpack__ for module bundling and styles compiling. The setup is pretty basic and imitates the initial configuration I use for all my projects.
For CSS preprocessing i use SCSS and usually try to make my code as dynamic as possible. Also, corresponding variables have the same names within WP theme settings (theme.json).



## File Structure 

*src* - source assets (js, scss, img, fonts)

*build* - files distribution for the app use

*inc* - php assets library
